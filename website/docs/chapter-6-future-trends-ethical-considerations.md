The overarching ethical principles of beneficence (doing good) and non-maleficence (doing no harm) must guide all stages of humanoid robot development. This requires considering the broader societal implications of new technologies and prioritizing human well-being.

## Examples

*   **Example 1 (Advanced Materials):** Imagine a humanoid firefighter robot with a skin made of self-cooling, heat-resistant polymers, allowing it to operate in extreme temperatures without damage, and a soft, compliant torso that can navigate through rubble safely without harming itself or anything it contacts.
*   **Example 2 (AI Advancements):** A medical assistant humanoid, powered by a multimodal foundation model, understands complex patient queries, interprets diagnostic images using its perception model, and generates empathetic responses based on its language model. It can also physically assist patients with movements, having learned delicate manipulation through embodied AI in simulations.
*   **Example 3 (Human-Robot Symbiosis):** An architect works collaboratively with a humanoid robot on a construction site. The human designs the overall structure, while the robot, with its enhanced strength and precision, handles the heavy lifting and intricate assembly, dynamically adjusting its movements based on the architect's verbal cues and gestures.
*   **Example 4 (Ethical Considerations):** A humanoid companion robot designed for elderly care accidentally administers the wrong medication due to a software glitch. The regulatory framework needs to clearly define whether the pharmaceutical company (for medication error), the robot manufacturer (for software defect), or the care facility (for operational oversight) bears primary liability.
